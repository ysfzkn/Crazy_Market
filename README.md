# Crazy_Market
Market queue implementation with circular array in JAVA.
This program represents a market case that works like this:
Customers arrive at the checkout at random time intervals in the range [0-2].
It takes a random period of [1-3] seconds at the checkout for each customer to receive service.
The customer in the queue to be served: If the waiting time of the customer in the queue is greater than 10 seconds, the customer at the beginning of the queue receives service. (the customer is removed from the queue) is selected from among customers using vowels in a given tongue twister if small.

The program continues to run until the customers receive service from the cashier as many as the number of customers given and finally prints the waiting times of the customers in the queue.
